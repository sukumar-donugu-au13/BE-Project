# Meetyng

Create Social Network is a educational project. The main idea is to demonstrate how one can build a large scalable project with Javascript. However you get the core functionality of social network by running one command and then you can build more on top of that.

Repository is divided into three main packages:

*  api This package contains API for Social Networking App, built with Nodejs, Express, GraphQL and MongoDB with Mongoose
*  Frontend Is a frontend for Social Networking App and Styled Components.
*  lib Is a Nodejs command line script, that helps users to install the Social Networking App with one command. This package is published to NPM as a create-social-network

## Features
* Messenger Real time messaging system.

* Notifications Get instant notification when someone follows/messages 
  you or likes/comments on your post.
*  News Feed Fresh posts from people you are following.
*  Explore New Posts and People.
